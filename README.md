# DS3ParamExtractor

This is a tool to extract binary .param files of Dark Souls III to a .csv format.

Binaries can be found under [releases](https://github.com/Pireax/DS3ParamExtractor/releases).

To use this tool extract the .param files from Data0.bdt using something like [BinderTool](https://github.com/Atvaark/BinderTool).
Then simply place this in the same folder as the .param files
(This tool currently only supports the conversion of .param files that have to do with weapons), and then run the tool.

If you want a header column simply use the argument `-H` when running the tool.
